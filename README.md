# OpenVPN route Github

Use this with OpenVPN server's `--client-connect` option to automatically
download Github IPs and push routes to client on every client connection.

When users start to find their connection to Github failing, they can simply
reconnect to get the latest routes and carry on.

This script will attempt to fetch Github IPs from https://api.github.com/meta
and generate the relevant config output.

Add the following to the OpenVPN's configuration

```
script-security 2
client-connect <path/to/this/project/build-config.sh>
```

# build-config.sh [output]

Running this will create default working directory in
`/tmp/openvpn-route-github`. It will also download `jq` into this directory
on first run.

## Sample output

# OpenVPN documentation 
Documentation on the `script-security` and `client-connect` options

>–script-security level  
>This directive offers policy-level control over OpenVPN’s usage of external
>programs and scripts. Lower level values are more restrictive, higher values
>are more permissive. Settings for level:0 — Strictly no calling of external
>programs.  
>1 — (Default) Only call built-in executables such as ifconfig, ip, route, or
>    netsh.  
>2 — Allow calling of built-in executables and user-defined scripts.  
>3 — Allow passwords to be passed to scripts via environmental variables
>    (potentially unsafe).  
>
>OpenVPN releases before v2.3 also supported a method flag which indicated how
>OpenVPN should call external commands and scripts. This could be either execve
>or system. As of OpenVPN 2.3, this flag is no longer accepted. In most *nix
>environments the execve() approach has been used without any issues.Some
>directives such as –up allow options to be passed to the external script. In
>these cases make sure the script name does not contain any spaces or the
>configuration parser will choke because it can’t determine where the script
>name ends and script options start.To run scripts in Windows in earlier OpenVPN
>versions you needed to either add a full path to the script interpreter which
>can parse the script or use the system flag to run these scripts. As of OpenVPN
>2.3 it is now a strict requirement to have full path to the script interpreter
>when running non-executables files. This is not needed for executable files,
>such as .exe, .com, .bat or .cmd files. For example, if you have a Visual Basic
>script, you must use this syntax now:  
>
>  ```--up 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\wscript.exe C:\\Program\ Files\\OpenVPN\\config\\my-up-script.vbs'```
>
>Please note the single quote marks and the escaping of the backslashes (\) and
>the space character.
>
>The reason the support for the system flag was removed is due to the security
>implications with shell expansions when executing scripts via the system() call.

>–client-connect cmd  
>Run command cmd on client connection.cmd consists of a path to script (or 
>executable program), optionally followed by arguments. The path and arguments
>may be single- or double-quoted and/or escaped using a backslash, and should be
>separated by one or more spaces.  
>The command is passed the common name and IP address of the just-authenticated
>client as environmental variables (see environmental variable section below).
>The command is also passed the pathname of a freshly created temporary file as
>the last argument (after any arguments specified in cmd ), to be used by the
>command to pass dynamically generated config file directives back to OpenVPN.  
>
>If the script wants to generate a dynamic config file to be applied on the
>server when the client connects, it should write it to the file named by the
>last argument.
>
>See the –client-config-dir option below for options which can be legally used
>in a dynamically generated config file.
>
>Note that the return value of script is significant. If script returns a
>non-zero error status, it will cause the client to be disconnected.
